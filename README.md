## ✨ About the Project

This is a classic **Blackjack (21)** game built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks and no libraries

### Key Features
- 🎮 Play against a computer dealer
- 🃏 Random card drawing logic
- 🎵 Sound effects for actions (deal, hit, stand)
- 🟢 Win, lose, and bust conditions
- 🎨 Clean, responsive UI

The goal was to strengthen my **DOM manipulation**, **game state logic**, **event handling**, and **media control** skills — all in a single, fun project.
